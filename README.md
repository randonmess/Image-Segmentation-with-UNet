# Image-Segmentation-with-UNet
Using TF Keras to built a UNet for image segmentation.
**Note: The `data` folder containing the training set could not be uploaded to GitHub**

## Objectives

* Build your own U-Net
* Explain the difference between a regular CNN and a U-net
* Implement semantic image segmentation on the CARLA self-driving car dataset
* Apply sparse categorical crossentropy for pixelwise prediction

## Results
The model was trained for 5 epochs and acheived an accuracy score of 88% on the training set.
